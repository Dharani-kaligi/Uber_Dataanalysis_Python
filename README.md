# Uber Data Analysis
# Objective
This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data to uncover meaningful insights. The data includes ride details such as the start date of the trip, the pickup location, and ride duration, among others. The goal is to extract key information, such as the day of the week each trip occurred on, in order to understand patterns in Uber ride activity.

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Uber trip records. The analysis involves extracting, cleaning, and transforming the dataset to derive actionable insights. Specifically, one of the key tasks is to analyze the day of the week on which each trip took place, which can reveal trends in ride demand.

# Key Features
-**Extract day of the week:**  For each trip, we extract the weekday (e.g., "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", etc.) from the START_DATE column.
-**Data Transformation:** Convert raw timestamp data into meaningful information, such as the day of the week.
-**Data Exploration:** Visualize the distribution of Uber rides across different days of the week.

## By the end of this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns such as:

- Which days of the week see the highest Uber activity.
- Seasonal trends in Uber usage.
- Correlation between day of the week and ride characteristics (if data is available).

# Technologies Used
-**Python 3:** Core programming language for data analysis.
-**Pandas:** Library used for data manipulation and extraction of weekdays.
-**Datetime:** Used to extract and manipulate date and time information.
-**Matplotlib / Seaborn:** Libraries for visualizing data.
-**Jupyter Notebook:** Environment for interactive analysis and visualization.

# Installation & Setup
## Clone the Repository
## Clone the repository using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-data-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd uber-data-analysis
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Run the Analysis
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the analysis in Jupyter Notebook. Open Jupyter Notebook and launch the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the relevant notebook file (e.g., uber_data_analysis.ipynb) and run the cells to perform the data analysis.

Data Processing Steps
Step 1: Extract the Weekday
The dataset contains a START_DATE column with timestamps for each ride. We extract the weekday (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, ..., 6=Sunday) using the pandas .dt.weekday functionality.

python
Copy code
dataset['DAY'] = dataset['START_DATE'].dt.weekday
Step 2: Map the Weekday Integers to Day Names
We create a dictionary to map the numeric weekday values (0 to 6) to their corresponding weekday abbreviations ('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', etc.).

python
Copy code
day_label = {
    0: 'Mon', 1: 'Tue', 2: 'Wed', 3: 'Thu', 4: 'Fri', 5: 'Sat', 6: 'Sun'
}
Then, we use .map() to apply this mapping to the DAY column, replacing numeric values with their string equivalents.

python
Copy code
dataset['DAY'] = dataset['DAY'].map(day_label)
Step 3: Analyze the Data
After the weekday extraction and mapping, we analyze the distribution of Uber rides by day of the week using various visualizations, such as:

Bar charts showing the number of rides per day.
Heatmaps to visualize the activity patterns over time (if data includes time and date).
python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Count the number of rides by day of the week
ride_counts = dataset['DAY'].value_counts()

# Create a bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.barplot(x=ride_counts.index, y=ride_counts.values)
plt.title("Uber Rides by Day of the Week")
plt.xlabel("Day of the Week")
plt.ylabel("Number of Rides")
plt.show()
Example Data Flow
Input Data:
START_DATE	PICKUP_LOCATION	RIDE_DURATION (min)
2023-01-01 10:00	Downtown	15
2023-01-02 09:45	Uptown	20
2023-02-10 14:30	Midtown	25
Output Data:
START_DATE	DAY	PICKUP_LOCATION	RIDE_DURATION (min)
2023-01-01 10:00	Sun	Downtown	15
2023-01-02 09:45	Mon	Uptown	20
2023-02-10 14:30	Fri	Midtown	25
Visualization Output:
A bar chart will display the number of Uber rides for each day of the week, such as:

Copy code
Mon    120
Tue    110
Wed    115
Thu    140
Fri    160
Sat    135
Sun    90
This information can then be used to generate insights, like whether Uber rides increase during the weekend or specific weekdays.
