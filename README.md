# Uber Data Analysis
# Objective
This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data to uncover meaningful insights. The data includes ride details such as the start date of the trip, the pickup location, and ride duration, among others. The goal is to extract key information, such as the day of the week each trip occurred on, in order to understand patterns in Uber ride activity.

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Uber trip records. The analysis involves extracting, cleaning, and transforming the dataset to derive actionable insights. Specifically, one of the key tasks is to analyze the day of the week on which each trip took place, which can reveal trends in ride demand.

# Key Features
-**Extract day of the week:**  For each trip, we extract the weekday (e.g., "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", etc.) from the START_DATE column.
-**Data Transformation:** Convert raw timestamp data into meaningful information, such as the day of the week.
-**Data Exploration:** Visualize the distribution of Uber rides across different days of the week.

## By the end of this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns such as:

- Which days of the week see the highest Uber activity.
- Seasonal trends in Uber usage.
- Correlation between day of the week and ride characteristics (if data is available).

# Technologies Used
-**Python 3:** Core programming language for data analysis.

-**Pandas:** Library used for data manipulation and extraction of weekdays.

-**Datetime:** Used to extract and manipulate date and time information.

-**Matplotlib / Seaborn:** Libraries for visualizing data.

-**Jupyter Notebook:** Environment for interactive analysis and visualization.

# Installation

**Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository using Git and Navigate the project directory.
**Install Dependencies:** Install Required Python packages.
**Run the Analysis:** Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the analysis in Jupyter Notebook. Open Jupyter Notebook and launch the notebook

Open the relevant notebook file (e.g., uber_data_analysis.ipynb) and run the cells to perform the data analysis.
